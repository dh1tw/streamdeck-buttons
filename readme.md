This repository is a library of custom buttons / elements I designed for the elgato / corsair Stream Deck. They are built on top of my (totally unofficial) golang [streamdeck driver](https://github.com/dh1tw/streamdeck).

Some of these buttons are used in the [streamdeck examples program](https://github.com/dh1tw/streamdeck-examples).
